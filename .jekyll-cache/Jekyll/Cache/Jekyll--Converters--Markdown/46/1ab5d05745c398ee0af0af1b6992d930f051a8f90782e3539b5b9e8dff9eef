I"K<p>Hello! I am Fen. Welcome to my website.<p /> <p>There are many things to see here. It represents my life work and hopefully all the work I have time to do on this earth. It includes the type of life of work that I and most people around me have undervalued for generations, the stories of the queer and disabled workers of the world. The stories that no one wants to look at because we had dreams that no one thought to hold up at the time. And now we are all so very mentally and physically ill, but you need us to get up and keep working. Hysteria for the new millennia it seems.</p> <p>I became too disabled to work my professional "dream job" or really any "normal job" in 2021. This website is my attempt to rise from the ashes. To provide voice and reason to those who have been beaten down so badly, for those that have forgotten that each and every one of us has unconditional value that no one can take away from us. To provide love where there is none.</p> <p>Please enjoy my collections, thoughts, rambles, and works.</p> <p>Fen.&lt;/br&gt; They/them/theirs &amp; hy/hym/hys.
